		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Once a contract labourer, left it all behind to pursue the dream of creating worlds and inspiring change, which further coalesced into a slightly less shiny dream, "The Starving Artist"! Starting in 2016, moved to Toronto to attend TFS' game dev course where I excelled with networking, leadership, mentorship, and worked towards personal growth.<br>
		Provided artistic/technical assistance to multiple capstone projects during my time at TFS, at the same time gathering/leading teams for multiple game-jams such as: Extra Life, ToJam, and Global Game Jam. Then after graduation the whole world stopped spinning for a super fun pandemic. Since then i've honed my skills in art & animation, focusing on <br>
		VFX and node-based shader creation, and also often writing GDD's and story/mechanic ideas for future projects, while also keeping my 3d modeling/animation in my pipeline to keep those skills sharp. Initially my skills were developed with 3ds Max, Photoshop, Z-Brush, Marvelous Designer, Substance Painter/Designer, Unity and Unreal. After graduation I had to teach myself new apps, currently proficient with Blender, GIMP, Unity
		and for the sake of video editing, DaVinci Resolve. My inspiration to make games comes from the worlds I used to explore as a kid, the way my imagination dissected every possibility when a tense or dramatic scene was unfolding, so I figured this next section is just as important as the rest.</p>

		<h3>Gamer History</h3>
		<p>First memories are of playing Tetris/Mario/Darkwing Duck/Ninja Turtles with my dad and brothers, but eventually they got tired of games and moved on, I did not. The first game I owned was Final Fantasy 7, for my 8th birthday my mum bought it on a whim not knowing she'd just set me on the path. I wa
		I was a JRPG die-hard after that, leading into an anime obsession which also introduced me to another obsession in art and <br>
		animation. Initially a Playstation fan, I switched allegience to xbox after "The great hack-ening" of Playstation in 2011 because I couldn't recover my account from them. My first games for xbox were Halo and Assassins Creed, and I spent ungodly amounts of hours playing them both, and I think that's why today I feel like an empathic brotherhood with the<br>
		master chief and Al'Tair and also my boy Ezio. Now, i've forgotten more games than most people will play in their life, and i'll play almost anything. Games aren't just a pastime for kids anymore, games are a way to connect </p>

				<h3>Trials of the Fallen - TFS Term 6 Capstone Project 2018 |Team Name: Dollar Coffee Games |Art Lead, VFX, shaders, animation(shared), 3d modeling(shared), texturing(shared) </h3>
				<p>Capstone project of my team in TFS, a top-down strategy game made for AR where a goddess of life/death holds trials for any warriors willing to risk eternal oblivion for a second chance at their previous life. Three characters, an archer, warrior and mage make their way through what seems to be a straight-forward dungeon until the goddess<br>
				starts laying traps, summoning beasts/monsters, and manipulating room layouts in a gauntlet of combat and treachery. The first capstone to attempt making an AR game which left us with minimal mentorship regarding project demands, setup, and optimization, as well as one of the smallest teams to create a playable demo with a trailer for people<br>
				to test and view during the presentation of their capstone. Initially I was the tech artist focusing on particle effects and helping the programmers communicate with the artists, eventually it was decided I would be art lead, responsible for the overall art design, communicating between artist/programmer, and picking up the slack where others<br>
				weren't performing. At the end of the project, me and the other 3d artist on the team had a few days of crunch just modeling/texturing/animating together, as much of it was left undone or "lost". It taught me that I can't always pick or trust my teammates, it costs nothing asking people if there's anything I can help with when i'm caught up.<br></p>

				<h3>Gearsenscion - TFS Term 6 Capstone Project 2017 |VFX, shaders, general 3d support</h3>
				<p>Capstone from the team one term ahead of me, needed help with particles and animated UI elements, and once again translating between artist and programmer. I was mainly a support/consultant role in this project as they had a really good team mentality and had a lot of their design fleshed out by the time I joined. Spent roughly 4 months on this<br>
				project near the end of it all, after which was my terms turn to do the same thing, so it was good experience seeing what we could expect going into the capstone term, switching from learning to full time developing. Working with this team was brief but I admired their team-building and professionalism, i'm unsure if I was able to emulate this in my<br>
				own capstone, no two teams are the same, but I will always strive for that level of teamwork.</p>

				<h3>Temple of the Aztecs - Extra Life Game Jam 2016 |Creative lead, game/level design(shared), art design, general 3d art(shared), shaders, VFX</h3>
				<p>The first game/game jam in my career, unfortunately the project is lost to the sands of time, we didn't know we actually made a good game! TFS used it on their website to promote the course for a few years but it's buried there in the bloat too. A team of four made a short but sweet puzzle based game where the player uses an ancient artifact to <br>
				navigate the temple of the aztecs and complete their puzzles to escape the temple or be sealed inside forever. The puzzles range from focusing light from a hole in the ceiling using the artifact to trigger doors or mechanisms, pushing/pulling large blocks using a telekenetic ability from the artifact, or time based pressure plates and platforming <br>
				The whole game was more of a lengthy tutorial consisting of three rooms and no hand holding, figure it out! As the team was small we all had a hand in game design and level design, in fact we each designed our own room layout and puzzle. I was in charge of art design and the other artist and I created assets as necessary, if someone thought of <br>
				something interesting to put in we would make it. I started this project as a kind of try-out as the team was made up of people from my class, and it worked out really well, we were together for almost every game jam and they were some of the few that stuck around and made it to graduation.<br>
				As there's no visual references, the artifact was a Gold triangle with a hole in the middle, and RGB colored crystal tips and the temple was a mossy stone collection of rooms with multiple levels, one level had a river flowing through it and it was made obvious that even though the sun shines through you can't climb out. RIP Temple of the Aztecs. </p>

				<h3>Q-Bot - Global Game Jam 2018 |Game design, level design, art design(shared), VFX, shaders, general 3d art(shared)</h3>
				<p>An arena-fighting robot game loosely inspired by our own super smash bro's smack talk. The whole team contributed equally, I designed the level and motivated the art direction to get the ball rolling but everyone contributed to the overall design. We all lift together. This team consisted of members across three terms of TFS students and<br>
				a times got a little hard to coordinate because of the overall size of what we were trying to make which was multiple unique robot characters to all fight in the arena at once. During this project I learned what scope creep is, we all had grand ideas of our own unique battle-bots but not enough time to make it happen and both artist and programmer<br>
				almost had to call it quits from exhaustion, we had to cut out and dumb down a lot of what we planned but it was a rewarding experience.</p>

				<h3>Goat Rescue - Toronto Game Jam 2018 |Creative support(supporting leads), Art design(shared), VFX, shaders, general 3d art(mostly mentor)</h3>
				<p>The first game jam I wasn't a leader of, it was nice to be able to relax compared to the constant buzz of "What about this, what should this be like, where do these fit in, what even is that?". The team was created by my juniors in TFS who wanted to practice some mechanic and coding ideas for their capstone, but I still played a supportive role<br>
				when they needed logic or technical insight. The project was more mechanic and development focused so the art is pretty minimal, it's just goats on the moon, there's also an easter egg mechanic to find another goat and I believe a car floating around the moon as a space-x easter egg. I designed what little art is there, and shared 3d art work with<br>
				the other artists, also playing a supportive/mentor role to them. This was a unique jam as it was already pretty much designed before the jam started so we all knew what to do and got to work which gave us time to chill a bit as needed, everyone also got along well and knew their strengths/weaknesses. The next project didn't go so well unfortunately.</p>

				<h3>Get Home - Global Game Jam 2019 |Creative lead, VFX, shaders, General 3d art</h3>
				<p> This project had some unexpected toxicity in it. Initially we had a team ready, without being too specific some people we knew didn't have a team so we let them join us, I was active in game/level design with another member and then got the art direction flowing and from there we all contributed. The person in charge of implementing the assets into<br>
				a build couldn't decide if they wanted to use Unity or Unreal and kept switching back and forth creating issues with the assets getting lost and also just a general waste of time, resulting in the end product being none of our work and placeholder Unreal assets. It was a pretty heavy blow to see everything we worked on just ignored or deleted because someone<br>
				didn't commit, and later we learned he did it on purpose because of a one-sided grudge with someone on the team. I think this taught me my biggest lesson so far in game development, sometimes over-eagerness followed by incompetence is a mask for sabotage.<br>
				I struggled thinking whether I wanted to put this entry in the portfolio or not but I feel like it belongs here, this project was like a stab in the back and it showed me I need to pay more attention when i'm in a leadership role and someone on an important task doesn't commit even if they're the senior or more knowledgable team member.<br>
				Meant to be a quick platformer about finding your way home after crash landing a spaceship, we were trying to use this as a showcase for what we learned at TFS and it didn't work out that way but I think the lesson we learned from it was worth more, unfortunately the team didn't get back together after that.</p>
